There are a few reasons why climate change may increase Dengue risk. First, the incubation period of the virus shortens in warmer temperatures, which means a mosquito doesnâ€™t have to survive as long to have a chance of becoming infectious. Second, the range of the mosquito is increasing due to global warming. In general, climate is a key factor controlling where a species can live. When climate changes, individuals move to stay in a suitable habitat.

**Have a variable to track change in climate**

89 percent of the distribution of Dengue fever cases was predicted by vapor pressure, which is a measure of humidity.

**May want to compare fever cases with precipitation and temperature, higher temps and rain will have an increase in humidity**

**Could calculate relative humidity in both cities**
